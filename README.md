# Auto-H
Voice and App Controlled Home Automation

Hello guys,
We have tried our hand building a home automation service controlled both through Android and Voice.

For voice we used the service JASPER.  
Files for RASPBERRY PI (programming language : python) , ARDUINO (using arduino IDE) JASPER and the ANDROID APK file are listed 
above.
